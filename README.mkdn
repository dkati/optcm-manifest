Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/CyanogenMod, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/dkati/optcm-manifest.git -b opt-cm-14.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
